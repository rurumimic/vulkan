## What are validation layers?

- Checking the values of parameters against the specification to detect misuse
- Tracking creation and destruction of objects to find resource leaks
- Checking thread safety by tracking the threads that calls originate from
- Logging every call and its parameters to the standard output
- Tracing Vulkan calls for profiling and replaying
